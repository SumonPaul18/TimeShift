#What is Timeshift?
Timeshift is a great tool, which monitors your system & application-level changes and gives you the ability to roll back your system in the previous state, in case, you run into a problem (Similar like Windows restore point).

#Install TimeShift in Ubuntu:

apt-add-repository -y ppa:teejee2008/ppa
sudo apt update 
sudo apt install timeshift -y

#Creating a Restore point:

timeshift --create --comments "A new backup" --tags D

#instruction:
--tags D
There are several tags, that specify what kind of backup it is.
As an example

--tags D stands for Daily Backup
--tags W stands for Weekly Backup
--tags M stands for Monthly Backup
--tags O stands for On-demand Backup

#Restoring a snapshot:

timeshift --restore
